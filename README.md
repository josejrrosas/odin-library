## 🧱 Project Objectives

- Practice using **objects** and **object constructors** in JavaScript.
- Understand and apply **prototypal inheritance**.
- Use **DOM manipulation** to display and update content.
- Build an interactive and responsive user interface.
- Store book data in memory using arrays.

---

## 🛠️ Steps Taken

- Created a basic HTML structure with a form and book display area.
- Wrote a `Book` constructor to create book objects.
- Managed books in an array (`myLibrary`).
- Added logic to display books as cards in the DOM.
- Enabled adding new books via a form.
- Added buttons to toggle "read" status and delete books.
- Styled the project using CSS (responsive and clean layout).

---

## 💡 Tips Used

- Used `Object.create()` and prototype methods for cleaner memory usage (optional).
- Attached `data-index` attributes to book cards for easy identification.
- Used event delegation where helpful for dynamic elements.
- Kept functions modular for easier debugging and readability.
